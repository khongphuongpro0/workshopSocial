&lt;p>At AWS, as we’ve helped customers implement their &lt;strong>SAP Cloud ERP Private&lt;/strong> workloads (formerly known as RISE with SAP), three questions understandably emerge:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>“How do we establish secure connections to our private cloud ERP environments?”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“What’s the most cost-effective network architecture for our use case?”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Should we implement &lt;strong>Direct Connect, Site-to-Site VPN&lt;/strong>, or both?”&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Network connectivity decisions made today will impact your SAP operations for years to come, affecting everything from system performance to disaster recovery capabilities.
