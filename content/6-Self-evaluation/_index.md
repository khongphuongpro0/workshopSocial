Throughout my internship at **[Company/Organization Name]** in the **FCJ (First Cloud Journey)** program from **[start date]** to **[end date]**, I had the opportunity to learn, train, and apply knowledge of Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Programming in a real-world work environment.  
I participated in **building the Cloud architecture and deploying the Social Media application onto the AWS platform (using ECS Fargate, ALB, RDS, VPC, etc.)**, thereby improving my skills in **architecture analysis, automation (DevOps), system error handling, and in-depth research on Cloud services**.

Regarding work attitude, I always strove to complete tasks and actively interact with colleagues. However, I recognize that there are still many shortcomings that need improvement.

To objectively reflect on my internship process, I would like to self-assess based on the criteria below:

| No.   | Criteria                                 | Description                                                                                                | Excellent    | Good  | Average    |

### Areas for Improvement and Lessons Learned

- **Regarding Discipline and Time Management:**

> I realize that I need to **seriously improve my discipline** during working hours. I sometimes failed to focus completely, leading to tasks being pushed to the final phase. The **lesson learned** is that adhering to schedules and regulations is not only a rule but also directly affects work efficiency and quality.

- **Regarding Responsibility and Task Completion:**

> Despite my best efforts, I was unable to complete the **final Deployment** step of the Social Media project onto AWS due to complex technical errors that arose near the deadline. This shows that I lacked adequate **contingency planning** and **risk management**. The **lesson learned** is not to leave crucial work until the last minute; sufficient time must be allocated for testing, error handling, and I must **report issues early** when I encounter intractable problems.

- **Regarding Problem-Solving Skills:**

> My ability to handle unexpected and complex errors, especially in a Cloud environment, needs improvement. I spent too much time trying to resolve an error independently instead of seeking timely assistance.
  >
  > _Improvement:_ Enhance **Problem-Solving Mindset**, especially the ability to perform **Root Cause Analysis**, and learn how to seek support from mentors or colleagues more effectively.

- **Regarding Communication:**
    > I need to learn to **communicate more clearly and concisely** in work and difficult situations, especially when **reporting progress or emerging issues** (e.g., deployment errors).

I have recognized these weaknesses and consider them invaluable experience for changing my work style and methodology in the future.
