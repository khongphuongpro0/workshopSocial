This section lists and introduces the in-depth technical blogs that I have researched and translated. These articles focus on topics such as **SAP on AWS**, **Hybrid Cloud Architecture**, and **AI/ML Applications in Software Development**, demonstrating an understanding and application of large-scale enterprise solutions.

###  [Blog 1 - Extending SAP FSM with AWS: A Clean Core Approach](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog introduces a **Clean Core Extensibility** solution for handling SAP Field Service Management (SAP FSM) data. The article describes a **Serverless** architecture (using API Gateway, Lambda, EventBridge, and S3) to **store SAP FSM attachments** in **Amazon S3**, which helps reduce data volume within SAP FSM and increases data control. This solution also unlocks the potential for integrating AI/ML services like Amazon Textract and Rekognition to process and analyze attachment content.

###  [Blog 2 - Building Enterprise-Ready Hybrid Network Connectivity for SAP Cloud ERP Private](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog presents three detailed network architecture options (Direct Connect, Hybrid DX + VPN Failover, Landing Zone) for establishing secure, reliable connectivity between the corporate network (on-premises) and the **SAP Cloud ERP Private** environment (formerly RISE with SAP) on AWS. The article analyzes factors such as performance, cost, latency, and fault tolerance, while guiding the use of services like **AWS Direct Connect, Site-to-Site VPN, and AWS Transit Gateway** to build an enterprise-grade network foundation.

###  [Blog 3 - Accelerating SAP Application Development with Amazon Q Developer](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog explores how to use **Amazon Q Developer**, a Generative AI tool, to boost productivity for SAP developers. The article highlights the challenges of legacy ABAP code and explains how Q Developer can help with **automated documentation generation**, simplifying the **SAP modernization** process (transition to S/4HANA and the Clean Core strategy). The tool supports the entire SAP ecosystem (ABAP, RAP, CAP) and has been reported to help increase developer productivity by up to 40%.
